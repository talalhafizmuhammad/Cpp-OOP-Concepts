A modern and beginner-friendly C++ project focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) foundations — explained through compact, real-world code examples.

This project is ideal for students, revision sessions, and anyone looking to solidify their understanding of key OOP concepts in C++ with simplicity and clarity.

## 📘 What’s Inside?

Master the building blocks of C++ with real, hands-on code examples covering:

- 🔹 **Structs** – Custom data structures made easy  
- 🔹 **Unions** – Memory-efficient shared storage  
- 🔹 **Enums** – Named constants for clean and readable code  
- 🔹 **Typedefs** – Cleaner code with custom type aliases  
- 🔹 **Minimalist formatting** – All code is concise and highly readable  
- 🔹 **Self-documented code** – Comments guide you line by line
- 🔹 **Classes** – Core of OOP, creating blueprints for objects  
- 🔹 **Inheritance** – Reusing and extending class behavior  
- 🔹 **Polymorphism** – Dynamic behavior through function overriding  
- 🔹 **Encapsulation** – Data hiding and abstraction  
- 🔹 **Constructor/Destructor** – Lifecycle of objects  
- 🔹 **File I/O with OOP** – Handling file operations within classes

## ❓ Why This Project?

C++ can be intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be. This repo simplifies OOP by:

- Using **real examples**, not just theory  
- Keeping files short and **modular**  
- Prioritizing **clarity** over complexity  
- Helping learners **grasp concepts quickly**
